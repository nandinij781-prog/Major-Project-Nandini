✅ PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This program is a Mini Game Pack that contains three different games inside one menu-driven application:

Guess The Number

Rock Paper Scissors

Snake Water Gun

The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to select any game, play it, and return to the main menu. It uses random number generation to create unpredictable game outcomes and offers simple, interactive gameplay through command-line input.

The program continues running until the user selects the Exit option.

✅ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE PROGRAM
1. Start the Program

When the program begins, it displays a main menu with four options:

Guess The Number

Rock Paper Scissors

Snake Water Gun

Exit

You must enter a number (1–4) to choose a game or quit.

2. Guess The Number

In this game:

The computer secretly selects a random number between 1 and 100.

The user tries to guess it.

After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess is:

4. Snake Water Gun
